# CANBusSniffer/Analyzer ESP32 Based

## Project Brief
There are many other options available around on the internet and github where there are people who have already build better versions.

Ive decided to build my own iteration of the CAN-Bus analyzer based on my own requirement's and need. 

## Things you need? 
- ESP32 (Any would really work. nothing special)
- IDF-V5.2.X (Definitely it can be used with other versions, i don't have too much time in hand to port it.)
- CANBus Transceiver Module (Ive got MCP2551)
